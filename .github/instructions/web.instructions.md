# General Formatting
- **Indentation:** Always use 4 spaces.
- **Spacing:** Space out operators (e.g., `const sum = a + b`).
- **Line Breaks:** Keep code on a single line; do not insert hard returns.

# Naming Conventions
- **JavaScript:** Use `camelCase` for functions/variables, `PascalCase` for classes/components, and `kebab-case` for file names.
- **CSS:** Use `kebab-case` for class names and IDs (e.g., `.main-container`).
- **Logic:** Functions should be named by their action (e.g., `fetchUserData`).
