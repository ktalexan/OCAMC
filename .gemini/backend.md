# General Formatting
- **Indentation:** Always use exactly 4 spaces.
- **Spacing:** Always use spaces before and after operators (e.g., `a == b`).
- **Line Breaks:** Do not break lines; use editor wrapping.

# Naming Conventions
- **C# / .NET:** Use `PascalCase` for methods and classes, `camelCase` for local variables and private fields (prefixed with `_`).
- **Java:** Use `camelCase` for methods and variables, `PascalCase` for classes, and `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` for constants.
- **Logic:** Use descriptive nouns for classes and verbs for methods (e.g., `TransactionProcessor.ExecutePayment`).
