# OCAMC GIS Repository Folder

This folder contains Geographic Information System (GIS) data, maps, and related resources used in the project. The GIS data may include shapefiles, geodatabases, raster files, and other spatial data formats that are essential for spatial analysis and mapping tasks within the project. The contents of this folder are intended to support spatial data management, analysis, and visualization efforts.

The GIS folder (may) include:
- An ArcGIS Pro project directory structure with associated project files (including `.aprx` files).
- One or more geodatabases (`.gdb` files) containing spatial datasets used in the project.
- A `maps` subfolder containing ArcGIS Pro map documents.
- A `layers/` subfolder containing ArcGIS Pro layer files used in the maps, and/or templates used in layer symbologies.
- A `layouts/` subfolder containing ArcGIS Pro layout files used for map printing and export.
- A `styles/` subfolder containing custom ArcGIS Pro styles for symbology and cartographic elements.

The folder also includes an `archived/` subfolder that stores older versions of GIS data and maps for reference and historical purposes.
