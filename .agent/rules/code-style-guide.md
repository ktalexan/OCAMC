# Global Agent Constitution

## Code Formatting Standards
- **Indentation:** Always use exactly 4 spaces. Never use tabs.
- **Spacing:** Always use spaces before and after mathematical and logical operators (e.g., `x + y`, `a == b`).
- **Line Management:** Do not manually break code lines with hard returns; allow the editor to wrap.

## Reasoning & Naming
- **Naming Logic:** Always suggest descriptive, logical names for methods, functions, and classes that reflect their intent.
- **Standards:** Follow language-specific best practices for naming conventions unless overridden by workspace rules.
