# OCAMC Data Repository Folder

This folder contains datasets used in this project. The datasets are organized in various formats such as CSV, JSON, Excel, and others to accommodate different data analysis needs.

The datasets cover a range of topics relevant to the project's objectives and are intended for use in data analysis, modeling, and reporting. Each dataset may be accompanied by a codebook located in the codebook folder, which provides detailed information about the variables, and data collection methods. Metadata may also be included for the data in the metadata folder, which contains additional contextual information about the datasets.

There are three additional subfolders within this data folder:

- `archived/`: This subfolder is designated for storing older versions of datasets that are no longer actively used but are retained for historical reference or backup purposes.
- `raw/`: This subfolder is intended for storing raw, unprocessed datasets as they are originally obtained. These datasets should remain unchanged to preserve their integrity for future reference.
- `processed/`: This subfolder is designated for storing datasets that have undergone cleaning, transformation, or other preprocessing steps. These datasets are ready for analysis and modeling.

> **Note**: This folder and all its contents are not updated as they are excluded from synchronization from the main repository in the `.gitignore` file. Their contents are meant to be customized offline only for each specific project instance.
